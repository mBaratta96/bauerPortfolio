4,The Immortal Story,Orson Welles,1968,"The most lucid reflection on the act of creation, captured in all of its complexity and contradictions, given to us by Cinema's greatest maverick. What is art true purpose? Where is the line between fiction and reality? What are we willing to do to cross that line? A mysterious, evocative fairy tale, and a lesson of what is possible to achieve in only 63 minutes of film."
0,Aparajito,Satyajit Ray,1956,"Life as a journey among conflicts: tradition against modernity, rural against urban environment, family against personal ambitions, optimism against grief. Quite possibly the most gentle and profound portrayal of a mother and son relationship, and a lesson on how looking from a distance may actually reveal the deepest aspects of life."
1,Barry Lyndon,Stanley Kubrick,1975,"The most sumptuous reflection on human destiny, freedom, and the relevance (or futility) of our actions. This is the pinnacle of Kubrick's formalism and an esthetical accomplishment that can't be possibly matched. Cinema has never been so beautiful and so tragic."
2,Brazil,Terry Gilliam,1985,"A perfect combination of Orwellian and Kafkaesque themes, which generates the most lucid satire of the 20th (and 21st) century. An unparalleled creation of a world in which the oppressing sociopolitical state teams up with our egocentrism to make reality a convoluted enigma. Moreover, a film in which each scene has a visual idea that could be studied for hours."
3,Heaven's Gate,Michael Cimino,1980,"A film in which every frame seems to capture the infinity of the world. Although similar to Barry Lyndon when it comes to pushing the limit of what a camera can record, Heaven's Gate aims at a complete different objective when it comes to its founding themes. Instead of metaphysical reflections, Cimino is interested in raw human emotions, making his film explode with excesses of greed, love, violence, friendship, betrayal. The most triumphant, enthralling and tragic epic in the history of cinema."
5,Viaggio In Italia,Roberto Rosellini,1954,"A hypnotic masterwork in which the fragmentation of human relationships is a reflection of the shattered reality. While still maintaining the solemnity of his neorealistic period, Rossellini shifts his look towards a more spiritual and existential plan, and delivers to us one of the most forward-thinking depictions of what modern life is. Moreover, few actors can match Ingrid Bergman's performance."
6,The Sacrifice,Andrei Tarkovsky,1986,"The most profound reflection on faith, aging, and the purpose of living. An apocalyptic elegy that ends with the most powerful climax I have ever seen on a screen."
7,Seven Samurai,Akira Kurosawa,1954,"The greatest utopia in Cinema's history. A thrilling tale of courage, friendship, and self-sacrifice in which the power of human spirit seems to prevail above anything, even a cruel nature. The perfect union of entertainment and philosophical reflection, and possibly the greatest movie ever made."
8,On The Silver Globe,Andrzej Żuławski,1988,"The most epic parabola about civilization, religion, and man's fascination to violence and power. A film that embraces its chaotic, dispersive nature, and uses it to fuel its hallucinatory imaginary."
9,A Woman Under the Influence,John Cassavetes,1974,"A personal favorite only for Gena Rowland's performance. But besides that, this is probably the most humanistic film ever made. Human emotions and relationships have never been described with such a heartfelt voice."
