0,Synopsis,"(Poster made by <a href='https://www.instagram.com/ooo.architecture/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' class='classes.link'>OOO Architecture</a>.)\nA man, with an unknown name, wakes up on a deserted rocky beach, not knowing who he is, or why he's there. While looking for someone to ask for help, he walks into a restaurant, where he finds a person who has been waiting for him. His name is Michele, and he is identical, in every aspect of his body, to the protagonist (they are both played by the same actor).\nConversing with Michele, the protagonist discovers that he is dead and that he is now in the afterlife. Michele is a spiritual entity who took the protagonist's form to explain his new condition. The world in which they find themselves, in fact, is the new, more modern and more efficient version of Hell: an otherworldly place that is the same in all respects as the world of the living, but inhabited by nobody but the protagonist. Therefore, he will find himself living in absolute solitude for the rest of eternity.\nMichele brings the protagonist to the place where he woke up, and shows him the reason he received this punishment. The protagonist has, in fact, strangled his girlfriend in an attack of jealousy.\nUnable to accept his condition, the protagonist tries to figure out how to get out of this new reality. He first considers throwing himself off the balcony of his house, believing that this will make him wake up in another world, exactly as one usually wakes up from a nightmare. Michele, however, immediately blocks him, and makes him understand that there is no easy way to escape his punishment, which has been precisely designed to conduct people to madness and despair. However, Michele later admits the total repentance may be a possible solution. If the protagonist takes the decision to inflict on himself the same pain that he inflicted on others, then he can hope to escape his punishment.\nThe protagonist chooses to hang himself to prove that he is ready to feel the same pain inflicted on the girl he had loved. However, as soon as the rope is stretched, it breaks for no apparent reason, letting the protagonist fall to the ground in a state of complete confusion. As he tries to tie the noose once more, the protagonist realizes that he does not have the courage to carry out the punishment he wants to inflict on himself, and goes back to his house in almost catatonic state. He finally sits down at the living room table, and starts scribbling something to pass the time."
1,,"In the opening scene, I wanted to present the protagonist in a setting that could reflect his nature of mediocre, spoiled and self-centered man. He is a person without an actual identity, or at least an identity that he decided to forge by himself. Through the movie, we will understand that all of his actions are driven only by ego, by the desperate search for someone else's approval. To represent all of this, I pictured a desolate environment, in which the life of barren Mediterranean vegetation barely emerges from rocks and concrete. I think this is an image that captures the existence of the protagonist: a life that is born out of lifelessness."
2,,"If the protagonist is a body without a soul, Michele is a soul without a body. Therefore, I thought that the best way to express this concept was to have the same actor playing both of the characters, using the dialogue to distinguish the two personalities. Michele is clever, well-spoken, and has also his own personal sense of humor. The protagonist, on the contrary, is timid, express himself with few, short sentences and there is a constant tremor of incertitude in his voice (As a side note: the duplication of the actor has been realized with the help of an AI algorithm. Take a look <a href='https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' class='classes.link'>here</a> if you feel curious)."
3,,"In a flash-forward, Michele shows the protagonist the state of madness he will fall after decades of solitude. I thought that showing these visions could express furthermore the nature of the protagonist. For example, I think this hallucination is an interesting way to show his egocentrism: when there is nobody that could possibly look at him, here's his mind creating precisely an eye that can judge him."
