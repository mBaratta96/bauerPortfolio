EXT. ROCKS - DAY #1#

The cold, restless sea throws itself on the rocks in a desperate struggle. The air is humid, so cold it cuts through the lungs. No seagull sings its chant in the cloudy sky. No vehicles cross the overpass in the distance. No sign of life, except for a man, lying on the rocks, who has just regained consciousness.

He gets up, and looks around. It seems like a familiar place, but he can't remember anything specific. Suddenly, he feels a stinging pain in the side of his neck. Touching with one hand, he realizes he has a barely healed scratch.

Carved into the rocks nearby, there is a staircase that seems to lead to a square that overlooks the whole beach. Not having a better plan, the man decides to go up.
