0,Synopsis,"The film covers the time span between 1888 and 1911. The two characters represent composers Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss, and they recite in voice-over a loose adaptation of the letters they exchanged for more than 20 years.\nWe see the development of their long-distance friendship across some pivotal events of their lives: Mahler's composition (and subsequent flop) of his 2nd symphony, their fight against Austrian royal censorship for the preparation of Strauss' Salome, the death of Mahler's daughter. As we assist at these episodes, the opposite personalities of the two artists emerge. Mahler is a tormented spirit that constantly fights to expand the limits of the musical form, whereas Strauss is a confident and productive artist whose sensibility is perfectly in line with his time.\nThe narration presents many anachronisms: emails, YouTube clips and Metacritic reviews. Although extravagant, these inserts are all meant to further explore the themes of the film, such as the struggle of the artist, the beauty of making art, and the friendship between two opposite human beings."
1,The Beginning,"At the initial stage of his career, Mahler struggles to find financing for his work as a composer. His closest confidant is a colleague that he respects extremely: Richard Strauss. Hoping to find inspiration, Mahler asks Strauss to send him the score of his two latest works, <i>Don Juan</i> and <i>Death and Transfiguration</i>."
2,The 2nd Symphony,"Inspired by the excellent work of his collegue, Mahler decides to finally conclude his new, groundbreaking, symphony."
3,The Censorship of Salome,"1905. Mahler is nominated artistic director and chief conductor of the Vienna State Opera, and Strauss' new opera — Salome — is receiving praise across all Europe. However, the combination of biblical themes and erotic undertones is a shock for the more conservative audiences. For this reason, when Mahler decides to bring the opera to Vienna, he has to face many obstacles."
4,A Tragedy,"As the battle against the censorship of Salome seems to reach a victorious end, Mahler's life is hopelessly shocked by two tragic events: he contracts a very painful heart disease, and his firstborn daughter dies of diphtheria. The Viennese preparation of Salome is stopped indefinitely."
5,Hope,"In the later years, things seems to have reached a balance in the life of both composers: Mahler seems progressively to recover from his disease, and Strauss is enjoying another long run of success. The two friends look back at their careers and reflect on the sense of music and history."
